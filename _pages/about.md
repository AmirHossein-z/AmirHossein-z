I am a developer who began my journey in September 2019, starting to program and learn about computer technology. I learned C++, jumped between different programming languages like Python, PHP, JS, learn about Network stuff, familiarized with the GNU/Linux operating system, learned Vim(that I can't leave without it), and tried to stick to a scope of this big world to learned deeply and efficiently. i.e front-end. Currently, it's been +3 years that I've been focused on front-end development. I love to implement useful things, whether it's a Web application or anything that solves user needs and creates real value. But I'm always looking for opportunities to improve my skills and learning new things in the computer world.

If you have any question, you can contact me through contact list provided in footer of this website.
